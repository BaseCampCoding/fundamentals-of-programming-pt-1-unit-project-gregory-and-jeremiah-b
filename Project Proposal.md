# Pokédex Finder
## Description
In this Project, We are going to create a Finder through the pokédex for each of the legendary pokémon from each Generation. 
More specifically, we want to ask the user for a legendary pokémon from a given list.
In the Pokémon games the Pokédex has a filter feature to let you  partially search and filter out pokémon, 
but you cannot necessarily search for a specific pokémon so we wanted to create a new feature that allows you to search for a specific pokémon.
This search can provide specific data such as in entry number, types, and pokédex entry.

## Prior Art
 In the games you can only search under a set parameter they give you. Instead of looking on the internet you can have the program run and find a legendary pokémon of your choosing. 
 
 ## Core User Workflows
 - Pokémon search: Since we're just making a searchable database, we only need the user to provide a name of the legendary pokemon they want to find in our database.
 
 ## Daily Goals
 
 ### *Tuesday:* Database should be half-way done
 We want to have at least half of our database done.
 
 ### *Wednesday:* Database should be complete and user input will be worked on
 We want to finish off our database so that we can get started making user input code. We plan to experiment with our code until user input is simple.
 
 ### *Thrusday:* User input should return info from database
 We should be able to ask for user input and return information based of their input.
