# Pokédex Finder
## Description
In this Project, We are going to create a Finder through the pokédex for each of the starter pokémon for the first three generations. 
More specifically, we want to ask the user for a pokémon from a given list.
In the Pokémon games the Pokédex has a filter feature to let you  partially search and filter out pokémon, 
but you cannot necessarily search for a specific pokémon so we wanted to create a new feature that allows you to search for a specific pokémon.
This search can provide specific data such as in entry number, types, and pokédex entry.

## Prior Art
 In the games you can only search under a set parameter they give you. Instead of looking on the internet you can have the program run and find a starter pokémon from the first three gens. 
 
 ## Core User Workflows
 - Pokémon search: Since we're just making a searchable database, we only need the user to provide a name of the pokemon they want to find in our database.
 
 ## Daily Goals
 
 ### *Tuesday:* Complete Database and start search features
 We want to have our 5-10 Pokémon done by today and then get a basic search feature implemented that allows you to search for a pokémon's name and will give you all available information.
 
 ### *Wednesday:* Search features should be complete
 We plan on having our search features where you can search up specific information such as type and generation introduced fully desinged by the  end of the day. 
 If we have extra time in the day then we might start early bug testing to make sure we impleted the lists correctly.
 
 ### *Thrusday:* Search features should be polished 
 Users should be able to easily search for names, types, generation introduced, and give them a list of pokémon names with that data for the user to choose one out of to get its information.
