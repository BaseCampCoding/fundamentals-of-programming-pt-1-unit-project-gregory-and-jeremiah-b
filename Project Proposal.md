# Pokédex Finder
## Description
In this Project, We are going to create a Finder through the pokédex for each of the legendary pokémon from each Generation. 
More specifically, we want to ask the user for a legendary pokémon from a given list.
In the Pokémon games the Pokédex has a filter feature to let you  partially search and filter out pokémon, 
but you cannot necessarily search for a specific pokémon so we wanted to create a new feature that allows you to search for a specific pokémon.
This search can provide specific data such as in entry number, types, and pokédex entry.

## Prior Art
 In the games you can only search under a set parameter they give you. Instead of looking on the internet you can have the program run and find a legendary pokémon of your choosing.
